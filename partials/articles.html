             Today people value many different things. Money is necessary to live, and to live comfortably making $100,000
             a year, there is no one that needs more money than that to live. Too many people place
             too much value on money. <br>The time value of money is the greater benefit of receiving money now rather than later. It is founded on time preference. The principle of the time value of money explains why interest is paid or earned: Interest, whether it is on a bank deposit or debt, compensates the depositor or lender for the time value of money. It also underlies investment. Investors are willing to forgo spending their money now if they expect a favorable return on their investment in the future.<br>The value of money is determined by the demand for it, just like the value of goods and services. There are three ways to measure the value of the dollar. The first is how much the dollar will buy in foreign currencies. Thatâ€™s what the exchange rate measures. Forex traders on the foreign exchange market determine exchange rates. They take into account supply and demand, and then factor in their expectations for the future.</p>

       The next century is for sure going to be challenging about managing with the limited natural resources. But as per the growing science and technology, scientists have always been able to generate alternatives and solutions in advance to manage the problems in the world. Thanks to DNA and robotic engineering, we will have created incredibly intelligent humans who are immortal. <br>
       People would be strong mentally and emotionally with more logical behaviours.We will have sussed nuclear fusion.Women will be routinely impregnated by artificial insemination rather than by a man.<br>
       May be we will start trading with the aliens. Inter-planet Communication Centres will be planted in NASA. There will be exchange of hyper-advanced technology in hardwares as well as software development.<br> Aliens would come on the earth in the UFO's as guests. <br>People would be extra intelligent with 50% more working brains as per now only 2% brain works as clearly mentioned in the movie LUCY. There would be more honesty and less cruelty, more peace and less crime rate as with 50% working brains people will be able to read minds and will have control over matters and situations.<br>
       Whole world will be territories of America and US Dollar currency will replace all other currencies in the world. California will lead the break-up of the US.

        Genetically modified foods is referred as genetically engineered foods, bioengineered foods, genetically modified organisms or foods produced from organisms whose DNA has been changed using the methods of genetic engineering techniques. <br>This allow for the development of new traits as well as give greater control over traits than previous methods such as selective breeding and mutation breeding.Commercial sale of genetically modified foods began in 1994, when Calgene first marketed its unsuccessful Flavr Savr delayed-ripening tomato. <br>Genetic modification affects many of the products we consume on a daily basis. As the number of GMOs available for commercial use grows every year, the Non-GMO Project works diligently to provide the most accurate, up-to-date standards for non-GMO verification.<br> Most food modifications have primarily focused on cash crops in high demand by farmers such as soybean, corn, canola, and cotton. Genetically modified crops have been engineered for resistance to pathogens and herbicides and for better nutrient profiles. <br>GM livestock have been developed, although as of November 2013 none were on the market.</p>
